READ BELOW FOR MAC OS CATALINA, BIG SUR, and MONTEREY USERS ONLY:
The recent Mac OS security settings  may not allow Unity to properly 
load Wwise soundbanks. To bypass the security precautions that the Mac OS has put in place 
you need to type the following line into the Terminal: 

sudo spctl --master-disable

Followed by your computer password to complete the command. This does leave your computer 
more open to hacker attacks, so do this at your own risk, be careful and consider yourself 
appropriately warned.  

Then when finished working on the project, 
restore the security settings with the following Terminal command:

sudo spctl --master-enable 

Note that you'll need to also enter your computer password after the command in order to
complete it.
